## Mipt_labs
### This repository created by Anton Shurygin (uslsteen) and Anton Orlovsky

If you happen to be on this repository, you either:
1) Want to roll a lab.
2) Want to check your lab with ours.

In this documentation, I will one day point out all the inaccuracies in each laboratory work.

So the notes:

# Lab. 3.2.2

# Lab 3.4.5

# Lab 3.6.1
