# Notes:

## 3_sem

- [lab 3.5.1](https://github.com/uslsteen/mipt_labs/tree/master/Phys_labs/3_sem/lab%203.5.1), [lab 3.6.1](https://github.com/uslsteen/mipt_labs/tree/master/Phys_labs/3_sem/lab%203.6.1) have some compilation issues due to initial writing in overleaf. 
- Honestly, the [lab 3.6.1](https://github.com/uslsteen/mipt_labs/tree/master/Phys_labs/3_sem/lab%203.6.1) was made with God's help, so its quality is not the best
